# Travel Planner

## Objective
Travel Planner is a travel assistant app that helps users organize trips from start to finish. The initial version includes two key features: Travel Itinerary Template and Cost Splitting.

## Features

### Travel Itinerary Template
The Travel Itinerary Template feature is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing trip itineraries. It gathers essential information about the trip, such as destinations, activities, travel dates, and times. The itinerary can be easily customized to meet the unique needs of each trip, with the ability to:

- Automatically generate a basic itinerary structure based on trip details.
- Add, modify, or remove sections such as activities, travel stops, lodging, and more.
- Support multimedia input, allowing users to attach images, maps, and notes to itinerary sections for a richer experience.
- Keep all trip details organized in a user-friendly interface.


### Cost Splitting Feature
The Cost Splitting feature simplifies financial management for group travel. It automates the process of calculating and dividing travel-related expenses among all group members. Key functionalities include:

- Inputting total expenses (accommodation, food, transportation, etc.) and the number of participants.
- Automatic calculation of each participantâ€™s share based on either an equal or custom split of the costs.
- Clear summaries of who owes how much to whom, reducing the need for manual expense tracking.
- A simple interface to track expenses throughout the trip, ensuring no one is left with outstanding payments.
